<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a motivated software engineer who made the transition from IT Tier 1 support into development, 
  driven by a passion for building solutions and solving real-world problems with code. 
  My background in frontline technical support has given me a strong foundation in troubleshooting, communication, and understanding user needs—skills 
  I now apply to writing clean, efficient, and user-focused software. 
  I’m excited to grow in this field, continually expand my skill set, and contribute to innovative projects that make an impact.</p>
